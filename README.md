# autoencoder_tf

This repository will be my backup data for emergencies, if for some coincidence of life you found it, please use it if you need to.
My work is just to learn a bit about how machine learning works, so I have no reasons to keep it for my self.

Please if you take code from the internet, is cool to use it, no problem, it's public so it's yours, but be a bit more humble and credit the authors from where you took
the reference code, don't need to be all of them, but don't go like "I am Jhon Snowden" without knowing how to do a print without the internet... Just it's not cool
man

-----INFORMATION

Auto_Den_Custom_Working (Working Progress): This is just a little experiment using a DnCNN, I took some papers for the layer of the model
structure but I don't know really why outputs blury images, probably it's due the pooling layers but not sure.

Autoencoder_denoissing (Finished): It's a Convolutional Autoencoder Denoissing Network, I have used the number
the dataset from Keras, just add some noise to the original photo and try to output a denoised one, works fine, the images
are 28x28 so trains quick.

Autoencoder_denoissing_Custom(abandoned): Anterior version of "Auto_Den_Custom_Working", very messy code and due to some
technical problems tf detects the GPU as the processing unit, not sure why, and I have tried to set CPU
as the main power calculator unit but nothing, don't take a look you don't need to.

Python_demo(abandoned-recovered): This just was an experiment with NN, I tried to use a simplified snake version
to try to train it to play, I took the snake tutorial from a youtube, really funny, someday I will keep working on it

---------------------
I know my code it's messy so, keep calm and let me clean it when I have time, no hard feelings, okey? :c
